§ Purple Dinosaur

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Purple Dinosaurs** have appeared in a number of //fictions// and //toy lines//.

The ones I am aware of include:

• **Dino** from **The Flinestones** cartoon who goes back to at least the year 1960,
• **Tyrantisaurus Rex** from the **Masters of the Universe** toy line who goes back to at least the year 1987,
• **Dinosorb** from the **Masters of the Universe** toy line who goes back to at least the year 1987,
• **Barney** from the **Barney & Friends** children's television show who goes back to at least the year 1992,
• **Megatron** from the **Beast Wars** cartoon and toy line who goes back to at least the year 1996,
• **Magmatron** from 

With the exception of **Dinosorb** all these **purple dinosaurs** are bipedal (assumingly) carnivorous dinosarus.
And usually something that looks similar to a //tyrannosaurus rex//.
